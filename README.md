Boris Bikes
===========

This Repo contains some sample Boris Bikes code (see 'sample' branch) and is set up with Travis Continuous Integration (CI) so that tests are run automatically when any code is pushed to the repository.

The badge below shows the status of the 'build', i.e. whether the current code has any failing tests:
